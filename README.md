# Network Security Engineer Portfolio

**⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLOSURE: This portfolio was built entirely with AI assistance**

This is a learning project created with the help of AI tools. I did not write the code myself - it was generated by AI to help me learn React.js, web development, and portfolio creation. This should not be considered as my original work or programming skills.

## About This Project

- **Purpose**: Learning React.js and web development
- **AI Assistance**: 100% of the code was generated by AI

## What I Learned

Through this AI-assisted project, I gained exposure to:
- React.js component structure
- Bootstrap CSS framework
- Git version control
- GitHub Pages deployment
- Modern web development workflows

## Honest Assessment

**This portfolio does NOT represent my programming abilities.** It was created by AI based on my specifications. I am transparent about this because:

1. **Ethical responsibility**: I believe in being honest about the tools used
2. **Learning transparency**: This is part of my learning journey, not a showcase of skills
3. **Professional integrity**: I want to be clear about what I can actually do vs. what was created for me
